I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="http://cs.njit.edu/"> Department of Computer Science </a> at <a href="http://www.njit.edu/"> NJIT</a>,
under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://web.njit.edu/~crix/"> Reza Curtmola</a>.
Currently, I am working on the software supply chain security aiming to ensure the integrity of the software from initiation to end-user installation.
I am also interested in pretty much everything related to virtualization-based security, operating system security, and malware analysis.
