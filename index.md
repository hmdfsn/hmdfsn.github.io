I am a PhD graduate in computer science from New Jersey Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.njit.edu/">NJIT</a>).
Currently, I am working as a research scientist at Cybersecurity Research Center at NJIT.
My work focuses on improving the integrity of the software supply chain from initiation to end-user installation.
I am also interested in virtualization-based security, operating system security, and malware analysis.
